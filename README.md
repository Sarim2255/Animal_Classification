## 🐾 Image Classification of Animals

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of animals into categories such as **bird**, **lion**, and others. It uses a supervised learning approach with image data organized into labeled folders.

### 🗂️ Dataset Structure
The dataset is stored in a folder named `datasets`, which contains subfolders for each animal class:
```
datasets/
├── Bear/
├── Bird/
├── Cat/
├── Cow/
├── Deer/
├── Dog/
├── Dolphin/
├── Elephant/
├── Giraffe/
└── Horse
├── Kangaroo/
├── Lion/
├── Panda/
├── Tiger/
├── Zebra/
```
Each subfolder contains multiple images of the respective animal.

### 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation)
- **Layers**: Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense
- **Activation**: ReLU and Softmax
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam

### 🧪 Training Process
- Images are resized and normalized
- Data is split into training and validation sets
- Model is trained over multiple epochs with accuracy tracking
- Early stopping or checkpointing may be used to prevent overfitting

### 📈 Evaluation
- Accuracy and loss are plotted over epochs
- Confusion matrix and classification report are generated
- Sample predictions are visualized to verify model performance

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarim2255/animal-classification.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
